## 2. Relationship of the Parties; Processing of Data

2.1 The parties acknowledge and agree that with regard to the processing of Personal Data, Customer may act either as a controller or processor and, except as expressly set forth in this Addendum or the Agreement, Materialize is a processor. Customer shall, in its use of the Services, at all times process Personal Data, and provide instructions for the processing of Personal Data, in compliance with Data Protection Laws. Customer shall ensure that the processing of Personal Data in accordance with Customer's instructions will not cause Materialize to be in breach of the Data Protection Laws. Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of (i) the Personal Data provided to Materialize by or on behalf of Customer, (ii) the means by which Customer acquired any such Personal Data, and (iii) the instructions it provides to Materialize regarding the processing of such Personal Data. Customer shall not provide or make available to Materialize any Personal Data in violation of the Agreement or otherwise inappropriate for the nature of the Services, and shall indemnify Materialize from all claims and losses in connection therewith.

2.2 Materialize shall not process Personal Data (i) for purposes other than those set forth in the Agreement and/or Exhibit A, (ii) in a manner inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Addendum or any other documented instructions provided by Customer, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Supervisory Authority to which the Materialize is subject; in such a case, the Materialize shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest, or (iii) in violation of Data Protection Laws. Customer hereby instructs Materialize to process Personal Data in accordance with the foregoing and as part of any processing initiated by Customer in its use of the Services.

2.3 The subject matter, nature, purpose, and duration of this processing, as well as the types of Personal Data collected and categories of Data Subjects, are described in Exhibit A to this Addendum.

2.4 Following completion of the Services, at Customer's choice, Materialize shall return or delete Customer's Personal Data, unless further storage of such Personal Data is required or authorized by applicable law. If return or destruction is impracticable or prohibited by law, rule or regulation, Materialize shall take measures to block such Personal Data from any further processing (except to the extent necessary for its continued hosting or processing required by law, rule or regulation) and shall continue to appropriately protect the Personal Data remaining in its possession, custody, or control. If Customer and Materialize have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data), the parties agree that the certification of deletion of Personal Data that is described in Clause 12(1) of the UK SCCs and Clause 8.1(d) and Clause 8.5 of the EU SCCs (as applicable) shall be provided by Materialize to Customer only upon Customer's request.

2.5 CCPA. Except with respect to Customer Account Data and Customer Usage Data, the parties acknowledge and agree that Materialize is a service provider for the purposes of the CCPA (to the extent it applies) and is receiving personal information from Customer in order to provide the Services pursuant to the Agreement, which constitutes a business purpose. Materialize shall not sell any such personal information. Materialize shall not retain, use or disclose any personal information provided by Customer pursuant to the Agreement except as necessary for the specific purpose of performing the Services for Customer pursuant to the Agreement, or otherwise as set forth in the Agreement or as permitted by the CCPA. The terms "personal information," "service provider," "sale," and "sell" are as defined in Section 1798.140 of the CCPA. Materialize certifies that it understands the restrictions of this Section 2.5.

## 3. Confidentiality

Materialize shall ensure that any person it authorizes to process Personal Data has agreed to protect Personal Data in accordance with Materialize's confidentiality obligations in the Agreement. Customer agrees that Materialize may disclose Personal Data to its advisers, auditors or other third parties as reasonably required in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Addendum, the Agreement, or the provision of Services to Customer.

## 4. Authorized Sub-Processors

4.1 Customer acknowledges and agrees that Materialize may (1) engage its Affiliates and the Authorized Sub-Processors, provided in Exhibit C of the Addendum, Materialize's current Authorized Sub-Processors (the "List") to access and process Personal Data in connection with the Services and (2) from time to time engage additional third parties for the purpose of providing the Services, including without limitation the processing of Personal Data. By way of this Addendum, Customer provides general written authorization to Materialize to engage sub-processors as necessary to perform the Services.

4.2 A list of Materialize's current Authorized Sub-Processors (the "List") is provided in Exhibit C of the Addendum. Such List may be updated by Materialize from time to time. At least ten (10) days before enabling any third party other than existing Authorized Sub-Processors to access or participate in the processing of Personal Data, Materialize will add such third party to the List and notify Customer via email. Customer may object to such an engagement by informing Materialize within ten (10) days of receipt of the aforementioned notice by Customer, provided such objection is in writing and based on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. Customer acknowledges that certain sub-processors are essential to providing the Services and that objecting to the use of a sub-processor may prevent Materialize from offering the Services to Customer.

4.3 If Customer reasonably objects to an engagement in accordance with Section 4.2, and Materialize cannot provide a commercially reasonable alternative within a reasonable period of time, Customer may discontinue the use of the affected Service by providing written notice to Materialize. Discontinuation shall not relieve Customer of any fees owed to Materialize under the Agreement.

4.4 If Customer does not object to the engagement of a third party in accordance with Section 4.2 within ten (10) days of notice by Materialize, that third party will be deemed an Authorized Sub-Processor for the purposes of this Addendum.

4.5 Materialize will enter into a written agreement with the Authorized Sub-Processor imposing on the Authorized Sub-Processor data protection obligations comparable to those imposed on Materialize under this Addendum with respect to the protection of Personal Data. In case an Authorized Sub-Processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations under such written agreement with Materialize, Materialize will remain liable to Customer for the performance of the Authorized Sub-Processor's obligations under such agreement.

4.6 If Customer and Materialize have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data), (i) the above authorizations will constitute Customer's prior written consent to the subcontracting by Materialize of the processing of Personal Data if such consent is required under the Standard Contractual Clauses, and (ii) the parties agree that the copies of the agreements with Authorized Sub-Processors that must be provided by Materialize to Customer pursuant to Clause 5(j) of the UK SCCs or Clause 9(c) of the EU SCCs may have commercial information, or information unrelated to the Standard Contractual Clauses or their equivalent, removed by the Materialize beforehand, and that such copies will be provided by the Materialize only upon request by Customer.

## 5. Security of Personal Data.

Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Materialize shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing Personal Data. Exhibit D sets forth additional information about Materialize's technical and organizational security measures.

## 6. Transfers of Personal Data

6.1 The parties agree that Materialize may transfer Personal Data processed under this Addendum outside the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland as necessary to provide the Services. Customer acknowledges that Materialize's primary processing operations take place in the United States, and that the transfer of Customer's Personal Data to the United States is necessary for the provision of the Services to Customer. If Materialize transfers Personal Data protected under this Addendum to a jurisdiction for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, Materialize will ensure that appropriate safeguards have been implemented for the transfer of Personal Data in accordance with Data Protection Laws.

6.2 Ex-EEA Transfers. The parties agree that ex-EEA Transfers are made pursuant to the EU SCCs, which are deemed entered into (and incorporated into this Addendum by this reference) and completed as follows:

In Clause 4(f) the language "adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC" is deleted and replaced with "a level of data protection that is considered adequate under, or equivalent to, the applicable data protection law." Clause 9, Governing Law, shall read "The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established, but without prejudice to the rights and freedoms that data subjects may enjoy under their national data protection laws." In Clause 11(3), the language ", namely..." at the end of the sentence is hereby deleted. Exhibit B of this Addendum serves as Appendix I of the UK Controller-to-Processor SCCs. Exhibit D of this Addendum serves as Appendix II of the UK Controller-to-Processor SCCs.

6.4.3 The UK Controller-to-Controller SCCs apply when the Materialize processes Customer's Personal Data as a controller pursuant to Section 9 of this Addendum. Clause II(h) of the UK Controller-to-Controller SCCs shall be deemed to state that the Materialize will process Personal Data in accordance with the data processing principles set forth in Annex A of the UK Controller-to-Controller SCCs.

Subject to the foregoing, all other requirements of Section 13 shall be observed.

6.5.4 The term "EU Member State" as utilized in the EU SCCs shall not be interpreted in such a way as to exclude Data Subjects in Switzerland from exercising their rights in their place of habitual residence in accordance with Clause 18(c) of the EU SCCs.

6.6 Supplementary Measures. In respect of any ex-EEA Transfer or ex-UK Transfer, the following supplementary measures shall apply:

6.6.1 As of the date of this Addendum, the Data Importer has not received any formal legal requests from any government intelligence or security service/agencies in the country to which the Personal Data is being exported, for access to (or for copies of) Customer's Personal Data ("Government Agency Requests");

6.6.2 If, after the date of this Addendum, the Data Importer receives any Government Agency Requests, Materialize shall attempt to redirect the law enforcement or government agency to request that data directly from Customer. As part of this effort, Materialize may provide Customer's basic contact information to the government agency. If compelled to disclose Customer's Personal Data to a law enforcement or government agency, Materialize shall give Customer reasonable notice of the demand and cooperate to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless Materialize is legally prohibited from doing so. Materialize shall not voluntarily disclose Personal Data to any law enforcement or government agency. Data Exporter and Data Importer shall (as soon as reasonably practicable) discuss and determine whether all or any transfers of Personal Data pursuant to this Addendum should be suspended in the light of the such Government Agency Requests; and

6.6.3 The Data Exporter and Data Importer will meet regularly to consider whether:

(i) the protection afforded by the laws of the country of the Data Importer to data subjects whose Personal Data is being transferred is sufficient to provide broadly equivalent protection to that afforded in the EEA or the UK, whichever the case may be;

(ii) additional measures are reasonably necessary to enable the transfer to be compliant with the Data Protection Laws; and

(iii) it is still appropriate for Personal Data to be transferred to the relevant Data Importer, taking into account all relevant information available to the parties, together with guidance provided by the supervisory authorities.

6.6.4 If Data Protection Laws require the Data Exporter to execute the Standard Contractual Clauses applicable to a particular transfer of Personal Data to a Data Importer as a separate agreement, the Data Importer shall, on request of the Data Exporter, promptly execute such Standard Contractual Clauses incorporating such amendments as may reasonably be required by the Data Exporter to reflect the applicable appendices and annexes, the details of the transfer and the requirements of the relevant Data Protection Laws.

6.6.5 If either (i) any of the means of legitimizing transfers of Personal Data outside of the EEA or UK set forth in this Addendum cease to be valid or (ii) any supervisory authority requires transfers of Personal Data pursuant to those means to be suspended, then Data Importer may by notice to the Data Exporter, with effect from the date set out in such notice, amend or put in place alternative arrangements in respect of such transfers, as required by Data Protection Laws.

## 7. Rights of Data Subjects

7.1 Materialize shall, to the extent permitted by law, notify Customer upon receipt of a request by a Data Subject to exercise the Data Subject's right of: access, rectification, erasure, data portability, restriction or cessation of processing, withdrawal of consent to processing, and/or objection to being subject to processing that constitutes automated decision-making (such requests individually and collectively "Data Subject Request(s)"). If Materialize receives a Data Subject Request in relation to Customer's data, Materialize will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer and Customer will be responsible for responding to such request, including, where necessary, by using the functionality of the Services. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that Data Subject Requests for erasure, restriction or cessation of processing, or withdrawal of consent to processing of any Personal Data are communicated to Materialize, and, if applicable, for ensuring that a record of consent to processing is maintained with respect to each Data Subject.

7.2 Materialize shall, at the request of the Customer, and taking into account the nature of the processing applicable to any Data Subject Request, apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to assist Customer in complying with Customer's obligation to respond to such Data Subject Request and/or in demonstrating such compliance, where possible, provided that (i) Customer is itself unable to respond without Materialize's assistance and (ii) Materialize is able to do so in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Materialize.

## 8. Actions and Access Requests; Audits

8.1 Materialize shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Materialize, provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance where necessary for Customer to comply with its obligations under the GDPR to conduct a data protection impact assessment and/or to demonstrate such compliance, provided that Customer does not otherwise have access to the relevant information. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Materialize.

8.2 Materialize shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Materialize, provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance with respect to Customer's cooperation and/or prior consultation with any Supervisory Authority, where necessary and where required by the GDPR. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Materialize.

8.3 Materialize shall maintain records sufficient to demonstrate its compliance with its obligations under this Addendum, and retain such records for a period of three (3) years after the termination of the Agreement. Customer shall, with reasonable notice to Materialize, have the right to review, audit and copy such records at Materialize's offices during regular business hours.

8.4 Upon Customer's written request at reasonable intervals, and subject to reasonable confidentiality controls, Materialize shall, either (i) make available for Customer's review copies of certifications or reports demonstrating Materialize's compliance with prevailing data security standards applicable to the processing of Customer's Personal Data, or (ii) if the provision of reports or certifications pursuant to (i) is not reasonably sufficient under Data Protection Laws, allow Customer's independent third party representative to conduct an audit or inspection of Materialize's data security infrastructure and procedures that is sufficient to demonstrate Materialize's compliance with its obligations under Data Protection Laws, provided that (a) Customer provides reasonable prior written notice of any such request for an audit and such inspection shall not be unreasonably disruptive to Materialize's business; (b) such audit shall only be performed during business hours and occur no more than once per calendar year; and (c) such audit shall be restricted to data relevant to Customer. Customer shall be responsible for the costs of any such audits or inspections, including without limitation a reimbursement to Materialize for any time expended for on-site audits. If Customer and Materialize have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data), the parties agree that the audits described in Clause 5(f) and Clause 12(2) of the UK SCCs and Clause 8.9 of the EU SCCs shall be carried out in accordance with this Section 8.4.

8.5 Materialize shall immediately notify Customer if an instruction, in the Materialize's opinion, infringes the Data Protection Laws or Supervisory Authority.

8.6 In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Materialize shall, without undue delay, inform Customer of the Personal Data Breach and take such steps as Materialize in its sole discretion deems necessary and reasonable to remediate such violation (to the extent that remediation is within Materialize's reasonable control).

8.7 In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Materialize shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Materialize, provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance necessary for Customer to comply with its obligations under the GDPR with respect to notifying (i) the relevant Supervisory Authority and (ii) Data Subjects affected by such Personal Data Breach without undue delay.

8.8 The obligations described in Sections 8.5 and 8.6 shall not apply in the event that a Personal Data Breach results from the actions or omissions of Customer. Materialize's obligation to report or respond to a Personal Data Breach under Sections 8.5 and 8.6 will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Materialize of any fault or liability with respect to the Personal Data Breach.

## 9. Materialize's Role as a Controller

The parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to Customer Account Data and Customer Usage data, Materialize is an independent controller, not a joint controller with Customer. Materialize will process Customer Account Data and Customer Usage Data as a controller (i) to manage the relationship with Customer; (ii) to carry out Materialize's core business operations, such as accounting, audits, tax preparation and filing and compliance purposes; (iii) to monitor, investigate, prevent and detect fraud, security incidents and other misuse of the Services, and to prevent harm to Customer; (iv) for identity verification purposes; (v) to comply with legal or regulatory obligations applicable to the processing and retention of Personal Data to which Materialize is subject; and (vi) as otherwise permitted under Data Protection Laws and in accordance with this Addendum and the Agreement.
