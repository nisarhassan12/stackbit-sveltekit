## 2\. Processing of Data

2.1 The rights and obligations of the Customer with respect to this Processing are described herein. Customer shall, in its use of the Services, at all times Process Personal Data, and provide instructions for the Processing of Personal Data, in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) and the United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018 (together, “Data Protection Laws”). Customer shall ensure that its instructions comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable in relation to the Personal Data, and that the Processing of Personal Data in accordance with Customer’s instructions will not cause Materialize to be in breach of the Data Protection Laws. Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of (i) the Personal Data provided to Materialize by or on behalf of Customer, (ii) the means by which Customer acquired any such Personal Data, and (iii) the instructions it provides to Materialize regarding the Processing of such Personal Data. Customer shall not provide or make available to Materialize any Personal Data in violation of the Agreement or otherwise inappropriate for the nature of the Services, and shall indemnify Materialize from all claims and losses in connection therewith. This Addendum does not apply to Personal Data for which Materialize is a controller.

2.2 Materialize shall not Process Personal Data (i) for purposes other than those set forth in the Agreement and/or Exhibit A, (ii) in a manner inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Addendum or any other documented instructions provided by Customer, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Supervisory Authority to which the Materialize is subject; in such a case, the Materialize shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before Processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest and (iii) in violation of the GDPR. Customer hereby instructs Materialize to Process Personal Data in accordance with the foregoing and as part of any Processing initiated by Customer in its use of the Services.

2.3 The subject matter, nature, purpose, and duration of this Processing, as well as the types of Personal Data collected and categories of Data Subjects, are described in Exhibit A to this Addendum.

2.4 Following completion of the Services, at Customer’s choice, Materialize shall return or delete the Personal Data, unless further storage of Personal Data is required or authorized by applicable law. If return or destruction is impracticable or prohibited by law, rule or regulation, Materialize shall take measures to block such Personal Data from any further Processing (except to the extent necessary for its continued hosting or Processing required by law, rule or regulation) and shall continue to appropriately protect the Personal Data remaining in its possession, custody, or control. If Customer and Materialize have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data), the parties agree that the certification of deletion of Personal Data that is described in Clause 12(1) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be provided by Materialize to Customer only upon Customer’s request.

## 3\. Authorized Employees

3.1 Materialize shall take commercially reasonable steps to ensure the reliability and appropriate training of any Authorized Employee.

3.2 Materialize shall ensure that all Authorized Employees are made aware of the confidential nature of Personal Data and have executed confidentiality agreements that prevent them from disclosing or otherwise Processing, both during and after their engagement with Materialize, any Personal Data except in accordance with their obligations in connection with the Services.

3.3 Materialize shall take commercially reasonable steps to limit access to Personal Data to only Authorized Employees.

## 4\. Authorized Sub-Processors

4.1 Customer acknowledges and agrees that Materialize may (1) engage its affiliates and the Authorized Sub-Processors listed in Exhibit B to this Addendum to access and Process Personal Data in connection with the Services and (2) from time to time engage additional third parties for the purpose of providing the Services, including without limitation the Processing of Personal Data. By way of this Addendum, Customer provides general written authorization to Materialize to engage sub-processors as necessary to perform the Services.

4.2 A list of Materialize’s current Authorized Sub-Processors (the “List”) will be made available to Customer, either attached hereto, at a link provided to Customer, via email or through another means made available to Customer. Such List which may be updated by Materialize from time to time. The List may provide a mechanism to subscribe to notifications of new Authorized Sub-Processors and Customer agrees to subscribe to such notifications where available. At least ten (10) days before enabling any third party other than Authorized Sub-Processors to access or participate in the Processing of Personal Data, Materialize will add such third party to the List. Customer may reasonably object to such an engagement on legitimate grounds by informing Materialize in writing within ten (10) days of receipt of the aforementioned notice by Customer. Customer acknowledges that certain sub-processors are essential to providing the Services and that objecting to the use of a sub-processor may prevent Materialize from offering the Services to Customer.

4.3 If Customer reasonably objects to an engagement in accordance with Section 4.2, and Materialize cannot provide a commercially reasonable alternative within a reasonable period of time, Materialize may terminate this Addendum. Termination shall not relieve Customer of any fees owed to Materialize under the Agreement.

4.4 If Customer does not object to the engagement of a third party in accordance with Section 4.2 within ten (10) days of notice by Materialize, that third party will be deemed an Authorized Sub-Processor for the purposes of this Addendum.

4.5 Materialize will enter into a written agreement with the Authorized Sub-Processor imposing on the Authorized Sub-Processor data protection obligations comparable to those imposed on Materialize under this Addendum with respect to the protection of Personal Data. In case an Authorized Sub-Processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations under such written agreement with Materialize, Materialize will remain liable to Customer for the performance of the Authorized Sub-Processor’s obligations under such agreement.

4.6 If Customer and Materialize have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data), (i) the above authorizations will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by Materialize of the processing of Personal Data if such consent is required under the Standard Contractual Clauses, and (ii) the parties agree that the copies of the agreements with Authorized Sub-Processors that must be provided by Materialize to Customer pursuant to Clause 5(j) of the Standard Contractual Clauses may have commercial information, or information unrelated to the Standard Contractual Clauses or their equivalent, removed by the Materialize beforehand, and that such copies will be provided by the Materialize only upon request by Customer.

## 5\. Security of Personal Data.

Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Materialize shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of Processing Personal Data.

## 6\. Transfers of Personal Data

6.1 The parties agree that Materialize may transfer Personal Data processed under this Addendum outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland as necessary to provide the Services. If Materialize transfers Personal Data protected under this Addendum to a jurisdiction for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, Materialize will ensure that appropriate safeguards have been implemented for the transfer of Personal Data in accordance with Data Protection Laws.

6.2 Where required, any transfer of Personal Data made subject to this Addendum to any countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection shall be undertaken by Materialize through the Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in Exhibit C to this Addendum, or, if available, an alternative compliance mechanism authorized pursuant to Data Protection Laws or subsequent guidance from EEA or United Kingdom regulators, as applicable.

## 7\. Rights of Data Subjects

7.1 Materialize shall, to the extent permitted by law, notify Customer upon receipt of a request by a Data Subject to exercise the Data Subject’s right of: access, rectification, erasure, data portability, restriction or cessation of Processing, withdrawal of consent to Processing, and/or objection to being subject to Processing that constitutes automated decision-making (such requests individually and collectively “Data Subject Request(s)”). If Materialize receives a Data Subject Request in relation to Customer’s data, Materialize will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer and Customer will be responsible for responding to such request, including, where necessary, by using the functionality of the Services. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that Data Subject Requests for erasure, restriction or cessation of Processing, or withdrawal of consent to Processing of any Personal Data are communicated to Materialize, and, if applicable, for ensuring that a record of consent to Processing is maintained with respect to each Data Subject.

7.2 Materialize shall, at the request of the Customer, and taking into account the nature of the Processing applicable to any Data Subject Request, apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to assist Customer in complying with Customer’s obligation to respond to such Data Subject Request and/or in demonstrating such compliance, where possible, provided that (i) Customer is itself unable to respond without Materialize’s assistance and (ii) Materialize is able to do so in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Materialize.

## 8\. Actions and Access Requests

8.1 Materialize shall, taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Materialize, provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance where necessary for Customer to comply with its obligations under the GDPR to conduct a data protection impact assessment and/or to demonstrate such compliance, provided that Customer does not otherwise have access to the relevant information. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Materialize.

8.2 Materialize shall, taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Materialize, provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance with respect to Customer’s cooperation and/or prior consultation with any Supervisory Authority, where necessary and where required by the GDPR. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Materialize.

8.3 Materialize shall maintain records sufficient to demonstrate its compliance with its obligations under this Addendum, and retain such records for a period of three (3) years after the termination of the Agreement. Customer shall, with reasonable notice to Materialize, have the right to review, audit and copy such records at Materialize’s offices during regular business hours.

8.4 Upon Customer’s request, Materialize shall, no more than once per calendar year, either (i) make available for Customer’s review copies of certifications or reports demonstrating Materialize’s compliance with prevailing data security standards applicable to the Processing of Customer’s Personal Data, or (ii) if the provision of reports or certifications pursuant to (i) is not reasonably sufficient under Data Protection Laws, allow Customer or its authorized representative, upon reasonable notice and at a mutually agreeable date and time, to conduct an audit or inspection of Materialize’s data security infrastructure and procedures that is sufficient to demonstrate Materialize’s compliance with its obligations under this Addendum, provided that Customer shall provide reasonable prior notice of any such request for an audit and such inspection shall not be unreasonably disruptive to Materialize’s business. Customer shall be responsible for the costs of any such audits or inspections, including without limitation a reimbursement to Materialize for any time expended for on-site audits. If Customer and Materialize have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data), the parties agree that the audits described in Clause 5(f) and Clause 12(2) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be carried out in accordance with this Section 8.4.

8.5 Materialize shall immediately notify Customer if an instruction, in the Materialize’s opinion, infringes the Data Protection Laws or Supervisory Authority.

8.6 In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Materialize shall, without undue delay, inform Customer of the Personal Data Breach and take such steps as Materialize in its sole discretion deems necessary and reasonable to remediate such violation (to the extent that remediation is within Materialize’s reasonable control).

8.7 In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Materialize shall, taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Materialize, provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance necessary for Customer to comply with its obligations under the GDPR with respect to notifying (i) the relevant Supervisory Authority and (ii) Data Subjects affected by such Personal Data Breach without undue delay.

8.8 The obligations described in Sections 8.5 and 8.6 shall not apply in the event that a Personal Data Breach results from the actions or omissions of Customer. Materialize’s obligation to report or respond to a Personal Data Breach under Sections 8.5 and 8.6 will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Materialize of any fault or liability with respect to the Personal Data Breach.

## 9\. Law Enforcement Requests.

If a law enforcement or government agency sends Materialize a demand for Personal Data, Materialize shall attempt to redirect the agency to request that data directly from Customer. As part of this effort, Materialize may provide Customer’s basic contact information to the law enforcement or government agency. If compelled to disclose Personal Data to a law enforcement or government agency, then Materialize shall give Customer reasonable notice of the demand and cooperation to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless Materialize is legally prohibited from doing so. Materialize shall not voluntarily disclose Personal Data to any law enforcement or government agency.

## 10\. Limitation of Liability.

The total liability of each of Customer and Materialize (and their respective employees, directors, officers, affiliates, successors, and assigns), arising out of or related to this Addendum, whether in contract, tort, or other theory of liability, shall not, when taken together in the aggregate, exceed the limitation of liability set forth in the Agreement.

_Clause 6_

**_Liability_**

1.  The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.
2.  If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.

The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.

3.  If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

_Clause 7_

**_Mediation and jurisdiction_**

1.  The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:

_Clause 8_

**_Cooperation with supervisory authorities_**

1.  The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.
2.  The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.
3.  The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b).

_Clause 9_

**_Governing Law_**

The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

_Clause 10_

**_Variation of the contract_**

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.

_Clause 11_

**_Subprocessing_**

1.  The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses[\[1\]](#_ftn1). Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor’s obligations under such agreement.
2.  The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
3.  The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
4.  The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter’s data protection supervisory authority.

_Clause 12_

**_Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services_**

1.  The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.
2.  The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

[\[1\]](#_ftnref1) This requirement may be satisfied by the subprocessor co-signing the contract entered into between the data exporter and the data importer under this Decision.
