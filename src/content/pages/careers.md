Stream processing software like Kafka has greatly improved the end-to-end latency of moving messages around in real time, but today there’s no good solution for making use of that data easily.\n\nMaterialize brings the user-facing simplicity of SQL views – for arbitrary SQL queries, not just a SQL-inspired minimal language – to the streaming data ecosystem.",
