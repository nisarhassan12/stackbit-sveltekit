## About the Meetup

Join Andy Hattemer and Joaquin Colacci from our Developer Experience team on October 13th at 2pm ET for a technical overview on the new Materialize.

### Topics Covered

- **Availability as a fully-managed cloud-native software-as-a-service platform**

- **Elastic storage (AWS S3), separated from compute** increases scalability and availability while reducing costs

- **Strict-serializability** eliminates stale data and enables strong consistency guarantees

- **Horizontal scalability** leverages[ Timely Dataflow](https://timelydataflow.github.io/timely-dataflow/) to let users handle large, fast-scaling workloads

- **Active replication** enables users to spin up multiple clusters with the same workload for high-availability

- **Workload isolation** enables users to spin up multiple clusters with different workloads while still leveraging shared elastic-storage, enabling collaboration without worrying about interference
