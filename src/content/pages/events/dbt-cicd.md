## About the Demo

Remember how you used to test SQL changes in production? Inspired by [Slim CI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/cloud-ci-job#configuring-a-slim-ci-job) in dbt Cloud, weâ€™ve been working on tooling to make dbt deployments more ergonomic in Materialize, from project linting to spinning up testing environments.

In this demo, we'll walk through setting up a CI/CD workflow for a dbt+Materialize project using GitHub Actions, and discuss the unique challenges of automating tests and deployments against a streaming database.

### Topics Covered

1. dbt+Materialize intro
2. Building a basic CI/CD workflow
3. Working with [`state`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/methods#the-state-method) and [`defer`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/defer)
4. What's next? ðŸ‘€

### Time and Date

Register to join us online on **Thursday, March 23 at 11am ET.** If you can't make the time, we'll send the recording and material to everyone after the event.
