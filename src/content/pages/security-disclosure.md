# Materialize Responsible Disclosure Policy

Data security is a top priority for Materialize, and Materialize believes that working with skilled security researchers can identify weaknesses in any technology.

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in Materialize’s service, please notify us; we will work with you to resolve the issue promptly.

## Disclosure Policy

- If you believe you’ve discovered a potential vulnerability, please let us know by emailing us at <security@materialize.com>. We will acknowledge your email within five business days.
- Please include a description of the bug and how you discovered it and any relevant logs or example code.
- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before disclosing it to the public or a third party. We aim to resolve critical issues within one month of disclosure.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid violating privacy, destroying data, or interrupting or degrading the Materialize service. Please only interact with accounts you own or for which you have explicit permission from the account holder.

## Scope

Materialize is on a weekly release schedule and expects all users to upgrade to the latest available version within two weeks of a release. Therefore, Materialize’s Responsibile Disclosure Policy covers only issues affecting the latest version and the version prior to it.

## Exclusions

This restriction applies to both the installed executable (materialized) and Materialize Cloud.Exclusions.

While researching, we’d like you to refrain from:

- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- Spamming
- Social engineering or phishing of Materialize employees or contractors
- Any attacks against Materialize’s physical property or data centers

Thank you for helping to keep Materialize and our users safe!

## Changes

We may revise these guidelines from time to time. The most current version of the guidelines will be available at https://materialize.com/securitydisclosure.

## Contact

Materialize is always open to feedback, questions, and suggestions. If you would like to talk to us, please feel free to email us at <security@materialize.com>.
